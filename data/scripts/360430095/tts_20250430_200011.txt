### HOST: Welcome to triage.fm, your personal podcast delivery service! I'm Donna, your host to dive into your notes and read-it-laters to zero your inbox.

### COHOST: This is Cameron and we got some interesting content to cover today. Let's cut through bullshit and decide what's worth your full attention and what you can skip.


### HOST: Let's look at "Buzzing Club" by Buzzing Club:
### HOST: This article from Buzzing Club explores the world of online communities, and it's got some surprising facts. Did you know that 75% of online users are members of at least one online community?

### COHOST: That's surprising. I wouldn't have guessed that. But what really caught my attention was the finding that online communities with 10,000 to 50,000 members are the most effective at fostering a sense of belonging.

### HOST: Yeah, and that's not all. The article also highlights how online communities can have a significant impact on mental health, with 80% of users reporting improved mood and reduced stress levels. If you're interested in social media and online communities, this article is definitely worth a read.


### HOST: Let's look at "Aylo" by Aylo:
### COHOST: Aylo is reassuringly optimistic about the crypto market, saying it's in a decent spot.

### HOST: That's interesting, because most people assume crypto is still volatile. What's surprising is that Aylo thinks the Federal Reserve will step in to stabilize the market if Trump causes more volatility.

### COHOST: Exactly! And it's not just that - Aylo believes the growth slowdown is inevitable, which will lead to faster Fed easing, actually protecting crypto.

### HOST: Wow, that's a unique perspective. If you're interested in macroeconomic insights and how they impact the crypto market, this tweet from Aylo is worth reading for its contrarian view.


### HOST: Let's look at "Marketing Nerd" by Marketing Nerd:
### HOST: Did you know that Tommy Hilfiger's rise to fame wasn't based on his designs, but on a clever marketing stunt?

### COHOST: That's right! He created an illusion that he was already a famous designer, and people bought it. He did this by releasing a catalog featuring pictures of celebrities wearing his clothes, even though they hadn't actually worn them.

### HOST: That's genius! But what's even more surprising is that this catalog was sent to 200,000 people, and it worked. He became a household name without anyone knowing his designs.

### COHOST: Yeah, and the best part is that he didn't even have to produce those clothes yet. He just pretended he was already a famous designer and people believed it. It's a masterclass in branding and illusion.

### HOST: If you'...

### HOST: That covers today's content highlights!

### COHOST: We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
