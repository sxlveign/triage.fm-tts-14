Co-host: This is Cameron and we got some interesting content to cover today. Let's cut through bullshit and decide what's worth your full attention and what you can skip.


Host: Let's look at "running fast nowhere - Eshita" by Eshita:
Host: This article argues that the crypto builder culture prioritizes attention over usefulness, leading to pointless projects that stagnate after launch.

Co-host: That's right, and it claims that teams focus on capturing attention for token price, rather than building a solid product, often leaving builders in an insecure position.

Host: What's striking is that the author says 80-90% of projects are built without a clear purpose beyond getting attention, and that's reflected in the fact that teams don't think about what comes after the token launch.

Co-host: And the author notes that this strategy is driven by the assumption that it's harder to excite and attract attention with usefulness than with novelty and speculation.

Host: If you're interested in the crypto space and want to understand the underlying dynamics, this article is worth reading for its unique perspective on the industry.

Host: That covers today's content highlights!

Co-host: We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
