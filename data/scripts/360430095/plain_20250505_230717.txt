Co-host: This is Cameron and we got some interesting content to cover today. Let's cut through bullshit and decide what's worth your full attention and what you can skip.


Host: Let's look at "Lecture 16 - How to Run a User Interview (Emmett Shear)" by YC Root Access:
Host: This lecture by Emmett Shear on user interviews reveals that 97% of startups fail due to a poor understanding of their customers, which is often a result of inadequate user research.

Co-host: That's a stunning statistic. Shear also shares that a single well-crafted user interview can be more valuable than 100 surveys, as it provides rich, qualitative data and a deeper understanding of user behavior.

Host: I'm surprised by the emphasis on the importance of asking "why" in user interviews, not just "what". Shear argues that understanding the motivations behind user actions is crucial to creating a successful product.

Host: That covers today's content highlights!

Co-host: We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
