<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>AI & Robotics Stealing Crypto's Thunder? | EP 73</b>" by <i>Good Game Podcast</i>:
<b>Host:</b> This episode explores how AI and robotics are disrupting the crypto space. One surprising fact is that Sesame AI, a US-based AI startup, is reportedly valued at $1.5 billion. That's a significant valuation for a company that's still relatively new.
