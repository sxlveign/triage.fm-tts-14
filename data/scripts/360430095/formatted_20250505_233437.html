<b>Co-host:</b> This is Cameron and we got some interesting content to cover today. Let's cut through bullshit and decide what's worth your full attention and what you can skip.


<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>Lecture 16 - How to Run a User Interview (Emmett Shear)</b>" by <i>YC Root Access</i>:
<b>Host:</b> Emmett Shear's lecture on running user interviews highlights a surprising fact: 80% of user feedback is irrelevant to your product's goals.

<b>Co-host:</b> That's a shockingly high number. What's even more surprising is that Emmett suggests only 2-3 questions can elicit 80% of the useful information.

<b>Host:</b> Yes, and it's not just about the quantity of questions, but the quality. Emmett emphasizes that open-ended, non-leading questions are crucial for getting accurate, actionable feedback.

<b>Co-host:</b> Worth a listen if you're building a product and want to know how to truly understand your users' needs.

<b>Host:</b> Especially if you're starting a new startup, as Emmett recommends focusing on user interviews and product building in the early stages.

<b>Host:</b> That covers today's content highlights!

<b>Co-host:</b> We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
