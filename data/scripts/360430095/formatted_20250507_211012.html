<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>Staring into the abyss as a core life skill | benkuhn.net</b>" by <i>Unknown Author</i>:
<b>Host:</b> The article defines "staring into the abyss" as confronting uncomfortable truths head-on, like Drew from Wave pivoting 11 times before finding success with Sendwave‚Äîwhich later grew so fast that most potential users adopted it within a year.

<b>Co-host:</b> Exactly! And Drew's team wasted 40+ employee-years on failed pivots, but that willingness to face hard decisions led to Wave's $1.7B valuation‚Äî3x Sendwave's sale price. Even Eliezer Yudkowsky admitted avoiding AI alignment truths for 6 years before updating his views.
