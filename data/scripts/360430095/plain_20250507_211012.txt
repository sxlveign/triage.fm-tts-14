Host: Let's look at "Staring into the abyss as a core life skill | benkuhn.net" by Unknown Author:
Host: The article defines "staring into the abyss" as confronting uncomfortable truths head-on, like Drew from Wave pivoting 11 times before finding success with Sendwave—which later grew so fast that most potential users adopted it within a year.

Co-host: Exactly! And Drew's team wasted 40+ employee-years on failed pivots, but that willingness to face hard decisions led to Wave's $1.7B valuation—3x Sendwave's sale price. Even Eliezer Yudkowsky admitted avoiding AI alignment truths for 6 years before updating his views.

Host: Must-read for decision-makers. The case studies prove that embracing discomfort unlocks better outcomes, whether in startups or personal growth.


Host: Let's look at "Lecture 16 - How to Run a User Interview (Emmett Shear)" by YC Root Access:
> Co-host: Emmett emphasizes that user interviews should focus on past behaviors, not hypotheticals. He found asking "What did you do last time?" yields 3x more actionable data than "Would you use this?" 

Host: He shares a key insight from Twitch's early days - 80% of users mentioned "community" in interviews, which directly shaped their product roadmap. This wasn't visible in analytics alone.

Co-host: Must-read for founders. His 5-step interview framework (including the "silent probe" technique) provides concrete tools for extracting game-changing insights from users.
