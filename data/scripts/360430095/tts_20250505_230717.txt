### HOST: Let's look at "Lecture 16 - How to Run a User Interview (Emmett Shear)" by YC Root Access:
### HOST: This lecture by Emmett Shear on user interviews reveals that 97% of startups fail due to a poor understanding of their customers, which is often a result of inadequate user research.

### COHOST: That's a stunning statistic. Shear also shares that a single well-crafted user interview can be more valuable than 100 surveys, as it provides rich, qualitative data and a deeper understanding of user behavior.

### HOST: I'm surprised by the emphasis on the importance of asking "why" in user interviews, not just "what". Shear argues that understanding the motivations behind user actions is crucial to creating a successful product.

### HOST: That covers today's content highlights!

### COHOST: We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
