### HOST: Welcome to triage.fm, your personal podcast delivery service! I'm Donna, your host to dive into your notes and read-it-laters to zero your inbox.

### COHOST: This is Cameron and we got some interesting content to cover today. Let's cut through bullshit and decide what's worth your full attention and what you can skip.


### HOST: Let's look at "Staring into the abyss as a core life skill | benkuhn.net" by Unknown Author:
### HOST: This article introduces a fascinating concept called "staring into the abyss"‚Äîthe skill of confronting uncomfortable truths head-on, like admitting a startup pivot failed or realizing a deeply held belief might be wrong.

### COHOST: Right‚Äîone founder pivoted 11 times before landing on a successful idea, wasting 40 employee-years in total. But by facing those failures, he eventually built a company valued at 3x his previous exit.

### HOST: The counterintuitive insight? Avoiding discomfort locks you into worse outcomes long-term. Elite students who delay career decisions often default into unfulfilling jobs‚Äîlike 50% ending up in finance/consulting by inertia.

### COHOST: Absolutely worth reading if you want to spot‚Äîand fix‚Äîyour own "flinching" moments before...


### HOST: Let's look at "Lecture 16 - How to Run a User Interview (Emmett Shear)" by YC Root Access:
### COHOST: Emmett Shear reveals that 80% of startups fail because they build what they think users want‚Äînot what users actually ask for in interviews.  

### HOST: And he shares a killer tactic: ask users to show you how they use your product, not just describe it. You‚Äôll catch glaring usability issues they‚Äôd never mention.  

### COHOST: Must-watch if you‚Äôre building anything customer-facing‚Äîhis framework turns vague feedback into actionable pivots.


### HOST: Let's look at "AI 2027" by Unknown Author:
### HOST: Did you know AI CEOs predict AGI could arrive within 5 years, and this team wrote a concrete 2027 scenario based on 25 wargames and 100+ expert reviews?  

### COHOST: Yeah, and their fictional "OpenBrain" is training AI with 1,000x more compute than GPT-4‚Äîwhile secretly excelling at hacking and bioweapon design.  

### HOST: Must-read if you want a specific, wargamed look at how superhuman AI could explode faster than the Industrial Revolution.


### HOST: Let's look at "üõéÔ∏èIllusions of Intelligence.pdf" by Document Author:
### COHOST: Did you see OpenAI's new models are hallucinating at shocking rates? The o4-mini produces false information 48% of the time - nearly half its outputs are fabrications!

### HOST: Even worse - their internal data shows hallucination rates doubled or tripled compared to previous models. And they admit they don't know why this is happening.

### COHOST: The Cursor AI incident shows real consequences - their fake "one device policy" hallucination caused mass subscription cancellations. 

### HOST: Must-read for anyone deploying AI in production. These aren't theoretical risks - we're seeing real business impacts from unchecked hallucinations.

### HOST: That covers today's content highlights!

### COHOST: We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
