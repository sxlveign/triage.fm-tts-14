Co-host: This is Cameron and we got some interesting content to cover today. Let's cut through bullshit and decide what's worth your full attention and what you can skip.


Host: Let's look at "Buzzing Club" by Buzzing Club:
Host: This article from Buzzing Club reveals some surprising facts about the most popular social media platforms.

Co-host: Like what? The article says that 70% of Twitter users have never tweeted, and 60% of Instagram users have never posted a story.

Host: That's mind-blowing. It also found that 45% of Facebook users have never shared a post, and 25% of TikTok users have never posted a video.

Co-host: Wow, that means a lot of people are just lurking online without contributing to the conversations. Worth reading if you're interested in understanding social media behavior.

Co-host: I love how he used a clever trick to create demand. It's a great lesson for marketers and entrepreneurs on the power of storytelling and creative marketing.
