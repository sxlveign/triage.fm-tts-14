### HOST: Let's look at "The Only 7 Signs of AI Writing You Need to Remove in Your Text | by James Presbitero Jr. | Write10x | Mar, 2025 | Medium" by James Presbitero Jr.:
### HOST: Did you know that AI-generated content can be easily identified using just seven signs?

### COHOST: That's right! According to James Presbitero Jr.'s article, these signs include overly formal language, a lack of nuance, and an abundance of clichés.

### HOST: But what's surprising is that even AI detectors can miss these signs, and editors and readers can still detect AI-generated content. And it's not just the quality of the writing that's the issue – it's also the unfair accusations against writers who aren't using AI.

### COHOST: Exactly! The article highlights that even if writers aren't using AI, they're still being accused of it, which can lead to rejected content, conflict with editors and bosses, and even damage to their reputation and income.

### HOST: That covers today's content highlights!

### COHOST: We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
