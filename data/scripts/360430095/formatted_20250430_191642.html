<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>Buzzing Club</b>" by <i>Buzzing Club</i>:
<b>Host:</b> This article from Buzzing Club reveals some surprising facts about the most popular social media platforms.

<b>Co-host:</b> Like what? The article says that 70% of Twitter users have never tweeted, and 60% of Instagram users have never posted a story.

<b>Host:</b> That's mind-blowing. It also found that 45% of Facebook users have never shared a post, and 25% of TikTok users have never posted a video.

<b>Co-host:</b> Wow, that means a lot of people are just lurking online without contributing to the conversations. Worth reading if you're interested in understanding social media behavior.

<b>Co-host:</b> I love how he used a clever trick to create demand. It's a great lesson for marketers and entrepreneurs on the power of storytelling and creative marketing.
