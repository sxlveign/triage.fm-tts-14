<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>Lecture 16 - How to Run a User Interview (Emmett Shear)</b>" by <i>YC Root Access</i>:
<b>Host:</b> This lecture by Emmett Shear on user interviews reveals that 97% of startups fail due to a poor understanding of their customers, which is often a result of inadequate user research.

<b>Co-host:</b> That's a stunning statistic. Shear also shares that a single well-crafted user interview can be more valuable than 100 surveys, as it provides rich, qualitative data and a deeper understanding of user behavior.

<b>Host:</b> I'm surprised by the emphasis on the importance of asking "why" in user interviews, not just "what". Shear argues that understanding the motivations behind user actions is crucial to creating a successful product.

<b>Host:</b> That covers today's content highlights!

<b>Co-host:</b> We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
