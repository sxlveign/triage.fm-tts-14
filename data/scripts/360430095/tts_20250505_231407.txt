### HOST: Let's look at "Lecture 16 - How to Run a User Interview (Emmett Shear)" by YC Root Access:
### HOST: Emmett Shear's lecture on running user interviews reveals a surprising fact: only 10% of user feedback is actionable, leaving 90% of feedback feeling vague or unclear.

### COHOST: That's shocking! He also emphasizes the importance of asking open-ended questions, citing that 80% of questions should be exploratory, rather than fact-finding.

### HOST: This lecture is a must-read for anyone building a product, as it challenges the assumption that data is the sole guide. By understanding what users truly want, you can redefine your product goals and create something that truly resonates.

### HOST: That covers today's content highlights!
